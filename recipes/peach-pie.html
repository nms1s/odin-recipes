    <h1>BALTIMORE PEACH PIE</h1>
    <img src="../images/peach-pie.jpg" alt="juicy peach pie">
    <h4>I've never been to Baltimore, so I can't comment on the current state of affairs, but what I can tell you is that this easy to make, yeast-based cake really is amazing.
        They say this recipe was brought to Baltimore by German immigrants, who apparently used to top it with caramelized onions. I don't know about onions, but any ripe,
        sweet fruit should work in this. Serve with ice cream if desired.  </h4>

    <h2>Necessary Ingredients</h2>
    
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>⅓ cup white sugar   </li>
                <li>1 package active dry yeast </li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups warm milk (no hotter than 100 degrees F (38 degrees C))</li>
                <li>¼ cup melted butter </li>
                <li>1 large egg, beaten </li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt </li>
                <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    <h3>For the top:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
                <li>3 ½ ripe peaches </li>
                <li>⅓ cup apricot preserves</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons Demerara sugar</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>Here is how to make it...</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Combine sugar and yeast in a bowl. Pour in milk, butter, and egg. Whisk together until sugar is dissolved.
             Stir in flour, a portion at a time, until mostly moistened, adding more if dough is too wet. Add salt and stir until a soft, slightly sticky dough comes together.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>Cover dough with a damp towel and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1/2 tablespoon butter. Split peaches in half along the seam and slice halves into quarters, then eighths.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Transfer dough into the buttered baking dish. Use a spatula to spread dough out to the corners of the dish.
             Cover with plastic wrap and let rise once more until roughly doubled in volume, 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
        <p>Arrange peach slices onto the dough, pressing them in lightly. Drizzle remaining butter on top. Sprinkle Demerara sugar over peaches.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake, not through a peach, comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>
        <p>Heat apricot preserves up with a splash of water and brush glaze over the top of the cake. Let cool to room temperature before slicing.</p>
