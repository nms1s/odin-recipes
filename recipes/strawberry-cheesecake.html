            </ul>
        </p>

    <h2>Here is how to make it...</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar, cinnamon, and butter in a bowl. Press onto the bottom of an ungreased 9-inch springform pan. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Place strawberries and cornstarch into a blender. Cover and puree until smooth. Pour strawberry sauce into a saucepan.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil and stir until sauce is thick and shiny, about 2 minutes. Set aside 1/3 cup strawberry sauce; cool. Cover and refrigerate remaining sauce for serving.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
        <p>Beat cream cheese in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy;
        gradually beat in condensed milk. Mix in lemon juice and vanilla extract,
        then beat in eggs on low speed until just combined. Pour half of cream cheese mixture over crust;
        drop half of reserved strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on cream cheese layer.
        Carefully spoon remaining cream cheese mixture over sauce; drop remaining strawberry sauce by 1/2 teaspoonfuls on top.
        Cut through top layer only with a knife to swirl strawberry sauce.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
        <p>Bake in preheated oven until center is almost set, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.
        Carefully run a knife around edge of pan to loosen; cool 1 hour longer. Refrigerate overnight.
        Serve reserved strawberry sauce with cheesecake. If the sauce it too thick, stir in water.</p>
